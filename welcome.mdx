Cicada is a CI/CD platform. Use our TypeScript SDK to write pipelines, then run them on every PR in our ultra-fast cloud 


Here's how to deploy your own Cicada pipeline in under < 2 minutes.


## 1. Create a Cicada Account
Sign up at [cicada.build/dashboard](https://cicada.build/dashboard)


## 2. Link a repository
Cicada will run your pipelines on every commit / PR to your linked repos.

## 3. Download the `cicada` CLI

<Snippet file="install-cli.mdx" />


## 4. Create a new pipeline

Navigate to your project from step #2 then run 

```bash
cicada init
```
This will create a simple example pipeline at `.cicada/my-pipeline.ts` that looks like [this](/guides/pipeline-examples)

## 5. Test your pipeline locally
Test changes to your pipelines locally using the `cicada` CLI
```bash
cicada run my-pipeline
```

## 6. Push your pipeline to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat:added cicada pipeline"
git push origin main
```

## 7. View your pipeline logs

Now go to [cicada.build/dashboard](https://cicada.build/dashboard) and watch your pipeline logs live!


## 8. That's it!
