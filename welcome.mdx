title: Welcome to Cicada
---

Cicada does two things:
1. Framework: Build CI/CD pipelines in TypeScript
2. Cloud: Run your pipelines in the cloud on every PR. 

With features like local testing and cross-pipeline caching, we're trying to be the fastest CI/CD tool out there.

But rather than telling you about it, why don't you just try it yourself!
