title: Edit a pipeline
---

### What are the core building blocks of pipelines?

* A **pipeline** is a file in your `.cicada/` folder. 
* A **job** is a container that executes code.
* A **step** is script (bash or deno) that runs in a job's container

### What does a pipeline look like?

```typescript my-pipeline.ts
    import { Pipeline, Job } from "https://deno.land/x/cicada/mod.ts";

    const job = new Job({
      name: "My First Job",
      image: "ubuntu:22.04",
      steps: [
        {
          name: "Print a message",
          run: "echo Hello, world!",
        },
        {
          name: "Run a js function",
          run: () => {
            console.log("Hello from js");
          },
        },
      ],
    });

    export default new Pipeline([job]);
    ```

## What should I run in my pipelines?
The most common things teams do in pipelines is:
* build code (e.g. with tools like `turbo`, `make`, or `bazel`)
* test code (e.g. with tools like `cypress` or `jest`)
* deploy infrastructure (e.g. with tools like `aws` or `terraform`)
* release code (e.g. to `npm` or `cargo` package registry)
* release artifacts (e.g. to `artifactory` or `github`)
* interact with software tools (e.g. close PRs in `github` or send a message in `slack`)

## How do I edit my pipeline?
Cicada's SDK lets you do all of the above and more - it's incredibly flexible.
