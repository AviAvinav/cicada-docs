## 1. Create a Cicada Account
Sign up at [cicada.build/dashboard](https://cicada.build/dashboard)


## 2. Link a repository
Choose a GitHub repository associated with your selected org. When you add a repository, Cicada will run any pipelines in that repo on every commit / PR.

## 3. Push your pipeline to GitHub

Go to your local respository where you have a Cicada pipeline (e.g. `.cicada/my-pipeline.ts`) and push it to GitHub

## 4. View your pipeline logs

Now on every GitHub PR go to [cicada.build/dashboard](https://cicada.build/dashboard) and watch your pipeline logs live!


## 5. That's it!
Congratulations, you have successfully set up your pipelines to run on every commit / PR.
