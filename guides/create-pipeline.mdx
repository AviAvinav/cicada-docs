description: Set up a pipeline in your project

## 1. Make sure you have the `cicada` CLI installed

<Snippet file="install-cli.mdx" />

## 2. Navigate to a local project
```bash
cd path/to/my/project
```

## 3. Run `cicada init`

```bash
cicada init
```
This will create a simple example pipeline at `.cicada/my-pipeline.ts` that looks like [this](/guides/pipeline-examples)
