title: What are pipelines, jobs & steps
---

* **Pipeline**: A pipeline is the highest level concept in Cicada. It is a TypeScript file like `build.ts`, `deploy.ts`, or `run_tests.ts`. A pipeline run is triggered when an event occurs in your repository such as a new commit or a pull request being opened. It takes one parameter: an array of jobs that are executed sequentially or in parallel.  
* **Jobs**: A job is a lightweight container that executes code. It takes one parameter: an array of steps.
* **Steps**: A step is either a shell script or Deno script that executes in its parent job's container
