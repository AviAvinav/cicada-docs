* **Pipeline**: A pipeline is the highest level concept in Cicada. It is a TypeScript file like `build.ts`, `deploy,ts`, or `run_tests.ts`. A pipeline is triggered when an event occurs in your repository such as a new commit or a pull request being opened. A pipeline is an array of jobs that are executed sequentially or in parallel.  
* **Jobs**: A job is an array of steps executed on the same container/runner.
* **Steps**: A step is either a shell script or Deno script executed in the job's container
